HealingTotem for Bukkit

Credits to tprk77 for original idea, coding and release.

I don't like pork. And I don't like eating it to gain health.
...ok, pork is delicious, but I need motivation for this plugin.

HealingTotems allows players to create totem poles that radiate healing powers.
Once a player is in range of a totem pole they are healed a little bit at a time
until they have full health. The properties of the healing are determined by the
totem pole's construction.

Features:
- Fully customizable. Customize the totem's construction (block pattern), the
  range, the power of the healing, and the rate of healing (not yet).
- Automatically detects the creation of new totems, no commands necessary.
  Automatically detects the destruction of a totem.
- Give totems negative healing to make them EVIL.
- Add environmental effects to your safe heaven or creepy dungeon.
- It's my first plugin!
